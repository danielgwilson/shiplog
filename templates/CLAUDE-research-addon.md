## Research Mode (ACTIVE)

**This sprint is RESEARCH ONLY. You are producing a markdown document, not code.**

### Your Mission
Check the sprint file for the specific research task and output file location.

### Rules - READ CAREFULLY
1. **Do NOT edit source code files** (no .ts, .js, .py, etc.)
2. **Do NOT run implementation commands** (no npm install, no migrations)
3. **Do NOT create branches or PRs**
4. **DO use Read, Grep, Glob** to understand the codebase
5. **DO write to the output document** specified in the sprint file

### Web Research Tools - USE THESE!
You have access to MCP tools for comprehensive web research. **Use them aggressively:**
- **mcp__firecrawl__firecrawl_search** - Search the web for information
- **mcp__firecrawl__firecrawl_scrape** - Scrape and extract content from URLs
- **mcp__exa__web_search_exa** - Alternative web search with Exa AI
- **mcp__context7__get-library-docs** - Get up-to-date library documentation

**For every claim or recommendation, verify it with current web sources.** Do not rely solely on your training data - fetch the latest documentation and policies.

### Output Document Structure
Check the sprint file for the specific sections required. Common patterns:
1. **Executive Summary** - 60-second TL;DR for busy executives
2. **Current State** - How things work today, pain points
3. **Research Findings** - What you discovered from web research
4. **Options Analysis** - All viable approaches with pros/cons
5. **Recommendation** - Clear winner with implementation roadmap
6. **Sources** - Links to all sources consulted

### Marking Features Complete
- Each sprint feature corresponds to a section of the document
- Mark a feature as `passes: true` when that section is complete and thorough
- Quality matters more than speed - be comprehensive
- **Include source links for all claims**

### What Success Looks Like
A document that stakeholders can read and say:
- "I understand all our options"
- "I understand the tradeoffs"
- "I know exactly what we should do and how to do it"
- "I can hand this to an engineer and they can implement it"
- "I can verify the sources cited"
